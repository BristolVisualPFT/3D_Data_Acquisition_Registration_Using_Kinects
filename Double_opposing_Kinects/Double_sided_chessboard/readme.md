# Double-sided Chessboard Preparation

To be able to use the registration code as it is, you must prepare three double-sided chessboards using the A3 chessboard template provided here as a pdf file i.e. "A3_6x5_chessboard.pdf". To make a double-sided chessboard, you can print the chessboard template on two separate A3 sheets and then join them back to back such that corresponding crossing points match together. Repeat this three times to obtain three double-sided chessboards. You can use solid cardboard as frame to keep the chessboards.
