# Double-sided Chessboard Preparation

To be able to use the registration code as it is, you must prepare three double-sided chessboards using the A3 chessboard template provided here as a pdf file i.e. [A3_6x5_chessboard.pdf](https://github.com/BristolVisualPFT/3D_Data_Acquisition_Registration_Using_Kinects/blob/master/Double_opposing_Kinects/Double_sided_chessboards/A3_6x5_chessboard.pdf). To make a double-sided chessboard, you can print the chessboard template on two separate A3 sheets and then join them back to back such that the corresponding crossing points match together. Repeat this process for making three double-sided chessboards. You can use solid cardboard as frame to keep the chessboards upright during the calibration process. The following image shows a sample setup of three of these chessboards.
