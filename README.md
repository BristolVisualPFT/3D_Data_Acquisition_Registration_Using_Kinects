-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
This is an open source implementaion of "3D data acquisition and registration using two opposing Kinects" [1]. This system is designed for acquiring and recording RGB, depth and skeleton data frames of two Kinects and register their RGB point cloud into a joint coordinate system.
