# 3D Data Acquisiton and Registration using Multiple Kinects #
-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
This is an open source implementaion of "3D data acquisition and registration using two opposing Kinects" [1]. This system is designed for acquiring and recording RGB, depth and skeleton data frames of two Kinects and register their RGB point cloud into a joint coordinate system.

To make the users life easier, two source codes are released:
+ [Single Kinect Acquisition:](https://github.com/BristolVisualPFT/Double_Kinect_3D_Data_Acquisition_Registration/tree/master/Single_Kinect_Data_Acquisition) To be used for capturing data by a single Kinect,
+ [Double opposing Kinects Acquisition and Registration:]() To apply two opposing Kinects and register their RGBD point clouds into a joint coordinate system.
