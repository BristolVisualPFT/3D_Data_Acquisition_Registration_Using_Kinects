# 3D Data Acquisiton and Registration using Multiple Kinects #
-----------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
This is an open source implementaion of "3D data acquisition and registration using two opposing Kinects" [1]. This system is designed for acquiring and recording RGB, depth and skeleton data frames of two Kinects and register their RGB point cloud into a joint coordinate system.

To make the users life easier, two source codes are released, one for a single Kinect configuration ([Single_Kinect_Data_Acquisition](https://github.com/BristolVisualPFT/Double_Kinect_3D_Data_Acquisition_Registration/tree/master/Single_Kinect_Data_Acquisition)), and the other one for applying two oppoosing Kinects to generate 3D RGB point cloud ([Double_Kinect_Data_Acquisition_Registration](https://github.com/BristolVisualPFT/Double_Kinect_3D_Data_Acquisition_Registration/tree/master/Double_Kinect_Data_Acquisition_Registration)). Both of the codes
